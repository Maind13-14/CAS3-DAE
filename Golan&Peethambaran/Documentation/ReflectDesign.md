Reflect
Description and Fabrication Process
———————————————————————————————————
 There are two objects that demonstrate the idea of Reflect. First prototype is the architecture model, where the user can understand the position of the waterfall and the scale of the structure. The model made out of cart-boards, mylar paper and plexiglass. The model is interactive, therefor the design is minimal and the user's focus will be on the interactive areas. The second part of the project is the waterfall printer reflation prototype that demonstrates the interaction between the users and the waterfall. In this prototype we used projector instead of water. For that reason the screen is made out of mylar paper and hanged from top to give the feeling of floating material.Machine and Tools
