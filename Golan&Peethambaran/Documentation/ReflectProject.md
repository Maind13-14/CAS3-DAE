Abstract
———————-
Water, an essential part of the Chinese and Hangzhou tradition is the main motif. The cirque arena will have waterfall printers running across the borders. The water fall printer in front of the lobby will print patterns related to the show as well as chinese culture. The waterfall printer in between the lobby and the seating area will reflect the people in front of it. It will behave as a flowing mirror printing the reflection of what is in front of the area. Canals run across the borders of the lobby below the waterfall printers. Just before the start of the show, automatic bridges come out connecting the lobby and the seating area for people to walk across.

Interface and Interaction Modality
—————————————————————————————————-
Reflect is an interactive water installation consisting of 2 waterfall printers. The waterfall printer in front of the lobby entices the audience walking in with a preview of waterfall printer displaying images related to the show and chinese culture.
The waterfall printer inside the lobby separating the lobby and the seating area acts as a flowing mirror reflecting people and material in front of the mirror. The user movements and gestures are captured and the shapes flow as waterdrops down from the waterfall printer.

The prototype is designed to provide users a sneak peak into the actual installation. 
The architectural model displays where the waterfall printers are located in the actual space of the cirque. The piece in front illustrates an actual waterfall printer created by LEDs. The image is lighted in a format such that the light flows from the top to the bottom similar to a waterfall. Near the wall between the lobby and the seating area there are three slots for inserting the model of a girl. When the user inserts the model, a flowing reflection is created using LEDs

The physical screen prototype has a screen on which a flowing reflection of users standing till 2m in front of it is reflected simulating the effect of water. When the reflection flows and touches the bottom of the screen a sound similar to water splashing plays in the background.


User Experience
——————————————-
The user interface is both simple and tacit. The waterfall printer in front of the lobby entices the audience walking in with a preview of waterfall printer displaying images related to the show and Chinese culture. All objects in front of the waterfall printer are reflected as a flowing image refreshing regularly. The gestures and movements of things in front of the printer are mirrored back to the users in a water flowing format with the splash sound when the water hits the floor.

Research and Development Context
——————————————-——————————————---
The aim of the project was to build an interactive installation for the audience of the cirque. Water being an integral part of Chinese culture, the project concept was developed around it. Also the lake and canal system being the essential parts of Hangzhou history, inspired us to create an experience derived from the same. Drawing inspiration from the waterfall printers in Japan and many waterfall curtains build for exhibitions, the project consists of waterfall printers near the wall in front of the lobby as well as the wall separating the lobby and the seating area. To enhance the experience of the users the printers between the lobby and the seating area was made into a reflective waterfall printer. A camera captures the images upto a distance in front of the screen and prints the images as black and white. To depict the canal system in Hangzhou, there are canals collecting water from the waterfall printer and running across the borders of the room. 

For prototyping the same and to create the experience of the actual installation, the project consist of two parts.
The architectural model showing the location details of the installation showing the positioning of the printers. LEDs simulate the actual feel of the environment by lighting up in a pattern similar to water flowing down.The different slots for the figure of the girl explains how the printer is reflecting what is in front of it.
 
The projected prototype captures the images from a kinect and is processed into a black and white flowing image by processing and displayed.
